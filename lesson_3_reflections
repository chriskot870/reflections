When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When sharing with others as well as having an offsite copy of your work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This keeps you in control on when you sync your local copy
	with the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Fork is a Github specific version of clone that only exists on Github
	A clone is a duplicate repository created from either a remote or
	local repository
	A branch is a symbolic name representing a 'tip" commit within a
	repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
